This project allows [Yamcs](www.yamcs.org) to collect data from the Belgian electricity "smart" meters via the P1 port.

The project is meant to showcase/test the [Yamcs Gateway](github.com/xpromache/yamcs-gateway) and is probably only useful to the Yamcs developers.

There are plenty of resources on how to connect to the smart meters via the P1 port, for example [here](https://jensd.be/1183/linux/read-data-from-the-belgian-digital-meter-through-the-p1-port)
